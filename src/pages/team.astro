        Our mission is to support 1 billion people in peer groups by 2053
        because we believe peer groups have the transformative power to provide
        every person with a place to learn and grow in a supportive community.
        Peer groups teach important skills for empathy, vulnerability, that
        enable meaningful connections and growth. The transformative power of
        forum has the exponential potential to change how we see ourselves, each
        other, the world, and our place within it. We support communities so
        communities can support the world.
